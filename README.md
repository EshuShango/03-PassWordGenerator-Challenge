![The Password Generator application displays a red button to "Generate Password".](./Assets/passwordGen.png)

## Description

Here is a working random PassWordGenerator, I had to code the JavaScript in order to make it work "properly"

## Task

This week's Challenge requires you to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.


## What I Learned

- the power of Functions are, at the least Powerful
- breaking a project down into small managable pieces will relief stress tremendously
- thinking in a logically way via computer language can be challenging, but it is doable 
- taking a break from a difficult problem will help you come back fresh with a solution (most times)

## RoadMap
 - I feel it is pretty effecient as of now, but as I grow and learn. My plan is to update my portfolio challenges.
 - CSS could be more "Jazzed Up"
